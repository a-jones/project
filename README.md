# project
Repo for Assignment 6. Updates have been made to this repo as a part of completing the assignment. It seems to contain some code for generating reports as well as notes from weekly meetings. To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the content or purpose of the files in the project folder.

To create a local repo use: git clone https://github.com/a-jones/project.git

The project environment is outlined in environment.yaml
